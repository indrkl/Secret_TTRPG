What differentiates a magic user from someone who is simply skilled at diplomacy? Or a fighter who can kill opponents
with a single swing?

That is the question I really wanted to answer when designing the magician path. And I wanted the answer to be satis-
fying.

But let's start with all the possible simple answers:

1. Theme. So the only difference is the description you can apply to your activity. Ranged spells would be as strong
as bows. Melee spells as strong as melee weapons. Charm person like spells as strong as using diplomacy check etc.
Yes, theme itself is important. The existance of magic and all the lore and dropes we have associated around it, are
certainly powerful, and I do like to have that theme, but if this is the only answer to this question, I would feel
very deeply dissatisfied.

2. Power. So magician do pretty much the same things that normal people do, but better, faster, with less steps, with
less people, etc. etc. which is thematically accurate in the sense that in all the movies, magicians are... really
fucking powerful. They cast a single fireball and half an enemy army is blown to pieces, they create complex objects,
which would require weeks for a craftsman to do within seconds etc. etc. The deep problem with this explanation is that,
if in the TTRPG you have the option to play a none spell caster, then why would you? That choice has to feel good even
for a MIN-MAX-er. And so, if the answer is just theme and power, then that is still very dissatisfying. If the answer
however doesn't involve power, then that is also the case.

3. But with limitations? DnD answered it with limitations. Yes, spells are strong but you can cast so many of them
before you run out. That gets you somewhere, but in a TTRPG setting, this means that the GM needs to balance the
encounters so, that you have both the targets for Nova damage, but then extra threats after the Nova has ended. This
puts a lot of pressure on GM. But this is an answer that has kinda worked, though mostly along side bringing the martial
and mage power levels close to each other. I mean this answer is already good enough for millions of people. Maybe it
is the best answer for a lot of them. I want an answer that however doesn't rely on balancing when players can rest,
where spells can potentially be a lot more stronger, but where mages are inclined to really choose hard, when to cast
the most powerful of spells.

4. Thematic, powerful, but with a cost. Ok, suppose the peek power of a mage is significantly stronger than martials in
combat, or skilled in scenes. You can choose to resolve a situation with magic, BUT, it costs you. In the current
iteration, spells are balanced in a way, that when using no mana they are always 1 dice behind martials or skilled when
achieving something with them. In the sense yes, you can cast spells, but their impact is not more powerful per se. But
if you use mana, then you can supercharge them to be much more powerful per dice used. The cost is mana, and to make
this cost real, it is not just a limitation. Recovering mana doesn't come easily, you need to consume special spices,
and they, cost money. They, can even be rare in some settings.

So, my answer to, how the mages are different from skilled and martials, is yes, they tackle the same challanges, but
1. they have thematically different solutions. They don't use diplomacy, but instead harmony magic with friendly
creatures, or discord to intimidate. They don't use weapons, but instead throw fireballs, freeze, curse, etc.

2. Their peek is significantly more powerful, but to achieve that peek, it is limited in the sense you have max mana and
you need downtown to recover mana, and it costs, since recovery costs money.

3. Using magic without mana makes them weaker compared to other paths, but they can still do it. 

4. The conclusion is they are there to put out power when it is most required, and they do it in unique, thematically
fantastic ways. They are a good pick for players who want to come up with crazy and creative ideas and solutions, and
who know to get the priorities straight.
