    """The wolrd of cathar is a world of magic, where the technology ranges from early medieaval to late ancient""",
    """The central tension is about the magical spices that grow only in certain locations, spread around the world""",
    """The central empire has made advancements in logistics, by improving sailing by using magic for navigation, wind
    prediction and tide manipulation""",
    """This is allowing them to make increasingly longer expansion voyages to conquer additional spice nodes.""",
    """This is affecting various other civilizations: 
    
1. the followers of the dark forest god Hurr in the expansive black forest. A series of tribal societies, with barbaric 
fighting spirit and culture.

2. The mountain people, who have built magnificant fortresses and mountain cities in the main mountain range going from
north east to south east of the continent. They are magnificant crafters, but keep to themselves, are isolationist and
don't trade much but are the only faction more technologically advanced than the central empire.

3. The peaceful island people, who like to trade a lot, and make up the bulk of the trade ships in the world. Their
combined fleet would be bigger than the one of the empire, but they are not organised enough. 

4. The horde of the great plains, proud horsemen and cattle keepers. They don't care for cities, and don't care for
anyone attempting to stop them using their plains. They have lot of inner warfare, which more works as population 
control than any form of power or dominance assuming, their life is a natural cycle of war and pasture. By living
through a conflict you have earned your place in the world, as they say.

5. The nation of the God King of Delta. A state built around a river, surrounded by lush jungle, accessible by sea only.
This is ruled by a God King Ramses. Around the delta there are big cities and large farm lands. Deeper in the jungle
there are vicious tribes, sneaky, ambushy, very diverse, some are more peaceful, others are cannibalistic, some have
very violent rituals etc.

6. The jungle tribes

7. The shamans of the north. Lowly populated area of the tundra.

8. Free cities of the north coast.
