The 

Ally: Seraphina is a skilled hunter and tracker, able to move with silent grace through the dense foliage of the jungle.
She is a 8 HP who dodges first attack each turn and has MV 8. and ATK 4. In addition she has 3 DEF and can recover DEF
while doing 2 less damage

Elder: Tala, old, short and fat, but is established with nature, divination and force magic. He has a divination that
the source of the problem is in the center of the jungle, which is much deeper than hunters and gathers usually dear to
travel.

His assistance Aria: who is the potion maker in down and got hurt when trying to gather a herb in the jungle, that is
required for making healing potions.

The jungle is poisoned by dark magic.

Symptoms: some plants have awakened and become dangerous, attacking players when they have come too close.

Some of the paths have grown in with poisonous wines.

Some of the animals have become more aggressive, since usually they avoid man.

A tribe of goblins have become hostile, and attacked a hunting party once, they had to abbandon their game, and several
of them got wounded.


The problems:

Village is running low on herbs for healing potions, the hunting and gathering has become more dangerous and goblins
pose an ever increasing risk to the village.

The objective:

There was a seal to an ancient evil, which is now broken somewhat, so the corruption sweeps through the jungle. The
seal was broken, when goblins stole one of the gems that were part of the seal. Placing it back will actually restore
order in the jungle.

The 4 gem stones that keep it in place are the gem stones of the 5 tribes in the jungle: humans (you), goblins, elves
and orcs. Only a person from matching race can remove the gem stone, which is why the goblin could only take one of the
gem stones. Apparently it was sealed 400 years ago, or 20 generations ago, which is why the exact details have been
forgotten. The gem stones used to be power items for each of the tribes but as they have been guarding an evil spirit,
then if you remove them, they also become corrupted, and also corrupts whoever holds 

The boons that can be found:

You can ask for supplies from the village. There are still some healing potions left.

When proving that your heart is good and solid, the jungle spirit will grant you a cloak of purity, which makes you
invisible from those with corrupted hearts. The test is that the evil spirit entices you to remove another gem and
promises power to you when you do that, while this is a trick, as you will unleash greater evil to the world if you do
so. Though it will give you power but it will also make it more dangerous for everyone and at some point the 3 remaining
stones will not be able to hold the dark wizard from returning to this world.

The hermit - Babbaa is the jungle trickster, if you solve his riddle, you get answers to 3 yes / no questions about the mystery.

A hermit, who is knowledgable about the jungle, lives on the road to the center. If you go to him, you find his tree-
top little house is being sieged by 5 man eating plants, each with 5 HP, and 3 ATK. The recluse is close to running out
of his food supplies, but will join the fight if you end up there as well. He can cast a small fireball every other turn
and otherwise taunts the plants in other turns.

He will reveal that there is a legend about our ancestors once upon a time sealing a great evil away from the world,
since he could not be killed, it appears as if the seal has been broken.

clothes and have much fairer skin color than your tribe's. The were killed by a poisonous snake, but now their items are
still around. A journal in strange language, some potions, backpack, rope, climbing equipment, and a magical dagger.
