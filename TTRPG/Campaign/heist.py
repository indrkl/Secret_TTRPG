Rich, but idle noble Riverick is out of town, and so a heist opportunity arises, to steal stuff from his mansion.
However the hint of him being gone turns out to be wrong, as the players stumble upon a meeting, between Riverick,
a Moria cutthroat Shivs and a vampire Malfoy discussing an assassination of the high priestess Joanna von Silverthorn.

The heist is 2 days before the festival, so time becomes of the essence. They can attempt to thwart it

    '''Joanna resides in the capital, there is a large monastery, which hold around 100 holy people.''',
    '''Warning her won't be easy, and since the players are simple criminals, noone is likely to believe them''',
    '''The plan is to perform the assassination in public, during the speach given by her for the celebration of 
    summer solstice.''',
    '''The distraction is going to be a fire, that should pull the city guards to handle that, and leave only a few
    Joanna's personal bodyguards.''',
    '''The idea is to detonate a paralyzing bomb next to Joanna to also hit the guards, and then Shivs rushes in
    and finishes Joanna by cutting her head off. Then he escapes through a portal, which is activated by Riverick.''',
    '''Activation must start 30 seconds before escape, and the portal is open for 18 seconds, so they have to time it
    carefully. Once the bomb hits, the activation must start''',
    '''The mansion is surrounded by a 2 m. wall, it has a 3000 m2 garden. The building itself is around 900 m2 and spans
    3 floors + basemant.''',
    '''
    To everyones surprise there isn't much valuables that could be stolen. In the bedroom, there are a few jewelry of
    the wife. Around the mansion, there are some paintings, but the question becomes how are you going to sell those?
    Especially most of hte paintings are family members of Riverick.
    
    The stone of portal for the job is in the basement, hidden under a piece of cloth. In the personal cabinet, there
    are various books of potential value.

Te olete üks väike gang vargaid ja seiklejaid, kes teevad nii legaalseid otsi, näiteks täidavad ohtlikke ülessandeid,
