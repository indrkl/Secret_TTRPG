Intro = '''
130 years ago a Silver mining town called Bryksö had an incident which concluded in the population of the entire town in
either dying or fleeing and so it has been abandoned ever since.

What was gathered from the bits and pieces from the rambling of fleeing villagers, and what was known before the 
incident, is that the Duke Karl of Bryksö went mad, was accused of necromancy by the local clergy and thus was executed 
by burning. At his final moments he had cursed everyone in the town. And so when the first person died a few months 
later, then instead of staying dead, they rose up as a zombie, killing their entire family, from then on the horror and 
spreading of the undead spread like wild fire, that lasted for 2 days and nights, after what noone has heard anything
or from anyone born in that town ever again.

Since it is considered dangerously cursed, normal folk don't go within 30 miles of the town. Occasionally adventurers go
and check this place out, usually never to return.

The most recent bit of knowledge came from a dimension wizard around 50 years ago, he travelled there with a group of
very well payed guards. He managed to teleport out of the place, but by the time he had chosen to do so, he had suffered
many bodily wounds, but most importantly, he had gone mad. He was mentioning something about a mansion, epicenter of the
curse, and kept repeating: "So cold, so cold!" But anyone failed getting any particular information, though it is
believed the mansion he kept talking about was the Duke's mansion, since there were no other magnificant enough 
buildings in the settlement.

For the last 10 years Tal'dorei republic's Master of defense Droxty has been wanting to reopen the silver mine since
there is Morei criminal syndicate, whome many are vampires, and that would help in the fight against them. Finally
he has found a group of characters with a combination of skill and crazyness to go and find out more about what
happened, to learn about the curse, and find a possible means to lift it, as he believes that 130 years ought to be a
long enough time to weaken the curse.

That group is you!

Regarding the characters, thing of why they would go on such a journey. Do they own a blood-debt to Droxty, are they
a criminal who seeks salvation? do they do 
anything for a price, is it out of honor, since they are a decendant someone from Bryksö? Is it just duty for the
republic, maybe you are invested in the hunt against vampires, or are you just flat out mad, or have a severe case
of curiosity? Whatever the case may be, you chose to accept the terms of 1000 gold, residency and house in Bryksö after
the town gets built back up, if you manage to lift the curse and of course anything of value you may find from
the Duke's mansion.

Also, think of things that you're character would do to prepare for the mission. And let me know beforehand.

Timeline = '''
Duke Karl of Bryksö found the rune stones, that had been activated already and connected to the Azkold realm. That
allowed him and some of the mages in his court to tap into heightened cold magic. This came in handy a few years later
when they pushed back a band of marauding orcs. After that the church of Azkold was founded, by the cousin of Karl,
John, proclaiming himself John of Azkold.

Dabbling in the cold magic, got the duke too busy, and he distanced from both his wife and the common folk. They started
talking about rumors about him. He on the other hand expected them to thankful for the defense against the marauders.

His wife, Madonna, got herself a lover, Fred, a young guardsman, who was very skilled with his sword, both of them.

One day a wandering monk joined the Azkold church, bringing a gift, a book that promised to conquer death and allow to
endure the coldness of Azkold. This became an obsession for both Karl and John. However the main ingredient for the
process of turning into a Lich was any magical artifact of enough power to be able to handle the power required to
manage the transformation and become the Lich's power object. Such artifacts are hard to come by, but they already had
one, the crown of Duke Karl. Naturally that meant that only one of them would rise into Lichdom.

John was jealouse and started to plot the downfall of Karl to get the Crown and transform into a Lich himself. However
until so he helped John to push onwards with the process.

Until one day when the betrayal happened. John told his church, that Karl was planning to sacrefice the lot of them
for a evil blood ritual, and must be stopped, since he has gone mad. They were sent around to go around the town and
spread this rumor. Since the town folk were already very suspicious of the Duke, this came easily. Also many from the
guard were swayed to betray, for Fred it came especially naturally to get rid of the old hag, to perhaps move up in the
world as Duchess Madonna would take over and he could marry a year later with the widow.

However Karl had already completed the process of becoming a Lich, he had sacrificed just a few peasant families. He had
however not achieved his full power yet, and so he got overwhelmed by the townsfolk, church of Azkold and betraying
guardsmen. When he saw just how complete was the betrayal, that all his subjects, his cousin, his wife, his guard, all
betrayed him, as he was burned alive, he cast a curse of such hatred: "Forever shall you serve me, for I am your Duke!"

The curse was about everyone who died in his Duchy, to return as undead unto his servitude.

John figured this out, but it was too late. The crown was now bound to Karl, and the crown was in the cellar, between
the rune stones, Karl had used the power of Azkold to zeal the deal, and safeguard the artifcat for himself. Until the
rune stones remained as they were, the crown would never forsake Karl, even though John had a ritual which could 
otherwise revert the effect and make him a Lich.

He however found out a second best option to prolong his odds of becoming a Lich. By making a ritualistic suecide he
managed to retain control over his ghostly mind, becoming a spectre, but still being bound to the place as part of the
curse. The curse sustained him, but did not control him, like it did everyone else.

Madonna and Fred were massacred by a group of zombies, as Karl unlocked a strengthened door, using magic from beyond, to
their sex dungeon. Now they haunt together, seeking for pain and lust to inflict upon any living who gets lost in the
mansion.

The guard captain and 3 guards who stayed loyal to the Duke until the end have been granted special Wraith powers and 
they guard the Crown, eternally. They are wraith nights.

The rest are skeletons or random ghosts, haunting the place and forever accessible to the power of Karl, though with
substantial limitations.

    '''Disable the connection to the Azkold realm. This can be done by simultaniously moving the knobs to the same

    which is the same number of moves away at all stones. These planes are legal moves. When moving the knob, the place
    starts to destabilize, and shake. If all the knobs are fixed but to a different plane, the thing will blow up. If 
    after certain time the knobs are not fixed to anything they vioulantly revert to Azkold plane and anyone near the
    stone will take damage. Hence the fallen Azkold priests who tried to close the gate beforehand. The trick is to
    have either magical strength, or physique skill to succeed. But you also need a way to communicate that you are

The rumors are that this mansion was cursed 2 centuries ago, when a local noble, who tried to conquer immortality by
becoming a Lich was hunted down and killed there. He cursed the town with eternal servitude. When the first person after
this incident died, they raised from the dead 3 days later as zombie, or as a wraith. Quickly it escalated killing the
whole city, with the few exceptions who managed to flee there. The manor of the Lich became the epicenter of the curse.

In the bottom most cellar, there is the crown of the Lich, this is where the power is all these years. If someone

    The crown is additionally enhanced through the Azkold realm, the realm of endless winter. There are ritual stones

The betrayals went in many ways. Someone wanted the crown to themselves, the lovers, the woman was the wife of the Duke,
but she didn't love him, and cheated on him with her lover. When the Azkold came to arrest the Duke, half of his guard
betrayed him, and the other half was killed.

During the execution, his people demonstrated the disgust they had towards him, which they had kept silent and in
secret so far. All of this made him despise and hate everyone so deeply, that allowed him to cast such a vile curse.

Azkold high priest seeks immortality, he commited a ritual suecide to retain his independence from the King, and still

The guard captain who stayed loyal to the Duke is the Martial ghost, he uses two weapon fighting together with Poof

A ballroom where all the nobles had their last dance and commited suecide by drinking a potion provided by John, this
let's them wake back up when John would retain Lichdom, and he would probably use them as fresh sacrifice. You see, the
poison not only gave them painless death, it also guarded their body from the curse and made their souls bound to him.

When players would start burning their bodies then they and John would quickly turn on the players, though possibly not
much they could do.

combat_balance_philosophy = """
So level 5 players have between 12 * 6 to 20 * 6 base HP. That is 72 - 120 HP. They also have 14 hit dice, which allows
them for 14 heals. A level 5 heal can heal 1dH + 6d8 HP. So we can assume these 14 hit dice push for another 30 * 14 hit
points, which is another 420 HP per player. Now of course heals cannot be handed out infinitely but a optimised healer
who is raw caster and has taken spell bombarber can at least cast lvl 2 heals. So even that is at least 3d8 * 14 = 
almost 200 HP.

So hits of 30 HP, or taking the party into low life after each fight is perfectly fine. Also in that sense everything
that freezes, is around 5 HP per stack, so they are more efficient to heal compared to damaging attacks, but require
quicker reaction. So 3-5 stacks of freezing every once in a while, is no problem. 

A triple attack with two handed swords can do 12d8 damage if all hit. That is 54 damage. Ok that is fine. It requires
all hitting.
