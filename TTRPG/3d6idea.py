Instead of d20 we use 3d6

Rolling 11 or more is exactly 50 %

So a DC of 10 means that anyone without proficiency would hit you with 62.5 % probability

From Grubs we know that +5 is a lot on a base check, bringing you to 95 %, meaning this is like have a +9 in DnD.
+1 equals +2.5, +2 equals +5, +3 equals +7, +4 equals +8 and +5 equals +9. However they have a much more signifant
impact on harder challanges, which otherwise are insurmountable for someone without proficiency.

Suppose +5 is max you can get from proficiency. Then you can get +1 from advantage, and +1 from inspiration. That can
bring you up to +7. Hmm

For armor. Light armor has a +1, medium armor has +2-3. Heavy armor has +3-4 + physical resistance.
Shield can give you up to +2, if you raise it. Meaning you can become really tanky. However offensive capabilities
still outperform late game. Though +5 is late level shit. But legendary folk do start with a +2, and can get to +3 at lvl 5 already.
Specialization progression traits can add another +1 once, but can only be taken by legendary and talented blokes.

But for armor you also have the defensive progression trait.

Critical thershold is +3, which can be reduced to no less than +1. All critical reductions are now a -1.

Luck tokens or luck in general means that you can reroll 1 of the d6s.

6d6 idea

Another idea is to use d6-s, and a lot of them, but instead of going by the SUM, you instead roll for example 6 dice,
and in order to perform an action you need to assign a pattern of specific dice. Like a pair of fives, or a trio
of fours, or a 1, 2 ,3, 4, 5. And instead of first choosing the action, you instead first roll the dice and see what
you can do. So the dice in a way become a resource of sorts.

This in theory creates a few new opportunities for game design.

1. Growth in some skill simply allows you to manipulate the results of the dice more easily.
2. Having multiple strategies, like using different weapons, different spells, simply to have a wider range of coverage
for the dice results could prove an interesting strategy
3. That allows for a feeling of constant progress, since the question is not weather you will be successful, but instead
how can you make progress. And if you really need to do something, then there can be various mechanics like inspiration,
pushing your luck, blood sacrifices, in addition to the normal manipulation options granted by your proficiency bonus.


Toughness and damage. When you take unmitigated damage, then you lose 1 dice, depending on your toughness that dice
can prevent that amount of direct damage before you lose another dice (of course substract the direct damage you already
took). For example you have 3 toughness and take 2 direct damage. You lose 1 dice and you mark that this dice will
mitigate 1 additional direct damage. Maximum toughness is 6. That way you can always mark your life pool with the dice
your d6-s you use for throwing, by either discarding them, or marking the last discarded with the amount it is still
mitigating.

Defenses and damage reduction. So light armor provides 1-2 defense every round. Defense prevents damage but is used up.
Since you recover it every round, it is still a substantial damage mitigation. Medium armor provides 3-4 defense.
Heavy armor also provides 3-4 defense, but in addition it provides 1-2 damage reduction, which reduces damage from all
instances. So only heavy hits will prove to be a problem at all.

Downside of heavy armor, is that both attacks and spells require an additional R2 to make. Upside of light armor is that
you can still use dodge. Upside of no armor, is that you get 1 additional dice.

Shield provides additional 1-2 defense, and if you do a guard action and get guard status effect you get an additional
1 damage reduction.

roll crit dice to see if you critically hit and how many critical effects you get. You need R6 to crit, and by default
one has 1 crit dice.
Critical hits for damage effects:
Option 1: double damage
Option 2: bypass damage reduction and defenses

Or skip crit entirely. Because all actions have bonus options, so by being able to push for more powerful bonus options
it is like critting.

For example

Axe attack R3,R3 - Deal 2 damage to single target
Option 1 - R4, remove guarded status effect before dealing damage
Option 2 - R3, Deal additional 2 damage
Option 3 - R6, bypass damage reduction
Option 4 - R6, bypass defenses
