Here are some ideas how to make this into a more structured collaborative story telling.

Divide the main story and group focuses into progression steps or beats. Have a general idea what each of the step
could include, like pieces of information that players learn, some encounters they could have. But be flexible. If
players succeed epically then be willing to bend your mind to skip a beat.

Use the "is there such a thing in the game-world" rule. Instead of saying yes or no, if this was not planned originally
decide how unlikely or likely such a thing is, unless of course if it thematically doesn't fit with the game world at
all. Ask why this is important to them, and what would they like to achieve with this. 

Then set the base DC (0, very likeyly, 5, plausible, 10, unlikely, 15, very unlikely, 20, nearly impossible) and roll a 
d20 to add to the base DC to make the final DC. Then choose a check they need to make, and if successful  then you
describe a way this can exist, and how they can achieve what they want using this knowledge.

If they fail, don't let that idea go to waste, or do, but if you don't you can think of a way to add it something 
similar in the game world that is neutral towards the players, or even worse, the enemy gets it. It could also be, that
players want an item, but in order to get it, there is mean guy, who is actually super dangerous and wields the item,
maybe even has a build around that, so it's gonna be risky getting that item.

That "is there such a thing in the game-world" should be able to use once per beat, and it should be used to advance
the focus or quest this beat is related to.

Divide the game into scenes. Each scene having a location, with a scope, a number of goals the party wants to achieve,
The structure:
 1. GM describe the scene
 2. Players formulate their goals and agenda and can request the "Is ther such a thing"
 3. GM explains the considerations for the agenda, and what rolls he expects.
 4. The rolls are divided by the players, together with AID rolls etc. and then the rolls are being made
 5. Based on the result the conclusion is being decided by the GM, along with the hint of options
 6. Players choose generally what they want to do next, thus starting the next scene.

It is possible the steps are not taken linearly, as GM may describe some more of the scene, or players may change the
plan as the GM explains considerations. Steps 3 and 4 should be considered as a negotiation of the tactics, but also to
manage the expectations of what could possibly go wrong.
