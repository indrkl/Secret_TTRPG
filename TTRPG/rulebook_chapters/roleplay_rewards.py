Whenever players meet an obstacle, which is hard for them from a roleplay point of view, and they take the penalty,
which results in failing the pass, they get sync points. These can be spent in various ways but can never be spent
during the same scene that they earned it in.

Rewards:

1 sync point - become inspired

2 sync points - recover up to 5 mana, 5 stamina or 5 defense, but you cannot go over your maximum, during combat. To
recover mana and stamina you must have spent that much during this encounter.

5 sync points - Through divine intervention, wierd luck, or some other reason to be decided on the spot, you are healed
fully without any of the dice turning scarred.
