Gold, as a resource requires a whole balancing philosophy. How to feel about the expenditure of gold? How should the
amounts of gold progress as the players gain levels. Obviously if you have kingdom levels of gold, you can get access
to a lot of things, but what things cannot be bought? Some magic items? Some favors? Some loyalties?

What if players have way too much gold? That ought to attract all sorts of trouble.

The problem becomes that if we tie some ability, like poison specialist with the amount of gold you are able to spend,
then the amounts of gold needs to be meaningful, but not too much.

The idea is that characters between levels 1-5 should operate in hundreds of golds. Meaning 100 gp should be a lot of
money. And you should get cool stuff for that. However spending around 100 gp on an encounter should also not be
discouraged.

For characters in levels 6-10, the big amount of money should be 300 gp, so, yes, it goes up, but not very dramatically.
But gaining up to few thousand gold should be plausible. Spending 500-1000 gp on an encounter that really matters
should not be unthinkable.

For characters in levels 11-15 we are talking in the thousands. So spending 5000 gp on a big encounter, fine. And
players should start to feel that actually money is no longer the limiter, but instead finding sellers, limited
resources etc.

all purchases of 1000 gp. availability shouldn't be taken for granted, even in capitals.

All purchases of 5000 gp+ should have some complications to outright not being available to some quest.

For characters above that, that is epic level shit, usually anything they couldn't afford before, they simply cannot
buy so easily, because there really is no market for this.
