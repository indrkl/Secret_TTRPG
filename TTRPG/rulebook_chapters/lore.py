Lore skill is about getting the information about the game world, the plot, and what not from the GM, but with the pace
and emphasises decided by the player.

When using the lore skill, there are some pillars that were considered when designing the system.

1. Each character in the world is a sponge of information to be retrieved from. A tavern could be a different sponge,
library another. The information each source can provide is different, but still vast.

2. Since it is TTRPG, we want the players to engage with the gameworld and initiate pulling of information, instead of
spoon feeding them, or even worse, shoving it down their throat.

3. The information GM provides the players without them asking does not require any proficiency with Lore. This is the
kind of information it is hard to ignore, is obvious, like a change of atmosphere in the city, people panicking, a
hostile group approaching players, they receive a message, some NPC decides to tell them something etc.

4. To take the pressure off GM. Players pulling information, by asking simpler questions with smaller junks is much
easier to answer, especially when the questions go into the territory which was not 100 % prepared and so the GM would
need to improvise. 

The current approach is to provide lore points, so to speak. Either by using normal scene dice roll and letting players
use lore proficiency to get more points.

These points are an abstraction of how well your information retrieval goes either through conversation or reading 
books. With these points you can ask questions from GM with the constraint that the source at hand should be able to
provide that information. There are several options:

for 1 point players can ask a simple yes, no, maybe question and get the appropriate answer, with perhaps some 
additional comments from GM.

For 2 points they can ask any question, but instead of getting an answer they get a small hint towards the answer.

If they want a straight answer to a conrete quesion, they can ask the GM, how much that question is worth, and GM can
decide. Some questions may of course have a price that is unattainable in the current scene, in this case it is better
to get hints.

Players can always set a goal, to get an answer to a certain question, in which case this can become the quest for them
for time being.
