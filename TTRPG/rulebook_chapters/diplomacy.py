Diplomacy skill, is about getting others to do something you prefer. It is about influencing the actions of others by
persuasion, speech, communication.

Diplomacy checks are similar in essence to all the roll-targets in the game. But there are some adjustments.

1. The range of dice used in the roll-targets range from 1 to 6 depending on the feel of the diplomacy. 5, 6 are
intimidation, heat of the battle, or negotiating with hostiles. 1 to 2 is for cold diplomacy, 1 and 6 expressing the
more difficult extremes. Everything else can be either 3 or 4. 4 being more rougher crowd, 3 being with friendlies.

2. The difficulty of those roll-targets can scale much more brutally based on who you are talking to and what is that
you want. The base-line is 3 dice. But it can be increased by: 

2.a Who you are talking to. An official, a guard, small business owner, failed aristocrat without land, 1 extra dice.
Successful business owner, Captain of the guard, confident individuals who have also seen some adventuring, village
elder, town head. 2 extra dice. City mayor, count, higher ranking officer, 3 extra dice. Duke, 4 extra dice, king, 5
extra dice.

2.b What you want to achieve. Something that substracts from the target by up to 1 % of their wealth or has them do up
to 1 days of work is 1 extra dice. For up to 3% of their wealth or up to 1 week of work,  2 extra dice. Up to 10 %
of wealth or up to 1 month of work, 3 extra dice. And so on.

2.c On the flip-side, you can offer something of value to lower the dice target with similar values to 2.b

3. So how can you manage roll-targets, which rely on for example 8 dice? This is impossible. Here comes the story cards.
Whenever party does something, completes a quest, does another great deed, something happens in the plot, or they just
create some general wibe, GM hands them a story card, which basically provides free diplomacy dice for certain 
encounters. For example you save a village from destruction, then you get a card which gives +1 diplomacy dice for
interactions with everyone in the village, and the ruling count who owns the village.
