Rituals are powerful spell effects which take a lot more time to cast and require much more mana than normal
spells. Like spells, the ritual caster needs to learn the ritual. However rituals can be casted by multiple spell
casters. Only one of them is required to know the ritual, but mages who do not know the ritual must spend twice as much
mana to contribute to it. When casting rituals it takes 1 hour to put half of mages maximum mana into the ritual.

Rituals can be used to prepare for combat against the odds.

Some rituals can have semi permanent effects, but they often have some daily mana cost. Meaning it is a constant
resource drain for the ritual caster.
