Exp system design goals:

1. Players should never feel like they should do something, that is not exciting / fun / interesting just to earn exp.

2. It should encourage them making risks, and being ok with failures.

3. Failure should be rewarded as much or even more than success. Exp is the main reward of failure. Rewards of success
are different, money, resources, progression in plot etc.

4. Encourage investing emotionally to your character and the game-world.

5. Not work against the group cohesion

Exp rewards for failure:

1. Exp for each scarred dice players get. 10 exp

2. Some scenes are big ones, and they provide experience, when the scene ends badly for players however, they get double
the experience from the scene. Recommended to start from 10 exp, but no more than 50 exp for the grandest of scenes.

3. When players have the choice of going to down-time or push forward, GM can entice them with exp if they go forward
to the next potential combat encounter.  Recommened to start from 5 exp, and not entice them with more than 25 exp.

4. Each character can have a role-play objective. This is set at start of session. If they complete it, they earn 10 exp
If they don't it's exp reward goes up by 5 for the next session.

5. Group as a whole has objectives. Completing those grants experience to all players and the group organization. The
objectives depend on the organization type. There can be 3 of them, each of them provides 10 exp if they are completed
during the session.


All exp earnt by a player only provides 10 % exp to the organization exp.
All exp earnt by all players (scenes and scene failures) provides 50 % exp to the organization exp.

The exp requirement to level up is 100 exp for lvl 1 and goes up by 20 exp each level. The exp gaining doesn't increase
much, since it is all tied to the difficulty of the encounter.

New player characters start at organization exp level.
