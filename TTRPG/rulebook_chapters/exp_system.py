Exp system design goals:

1. Players should never feel like they should do something, that is not exciting / fun / interesting just to earn exp.

2. It should encourage them making risks, and being ok with failures.

3. Failure should be rewarded as much or even more than success. Exp is the main reward of failure. Rewards of success
are different, money, resources, progression in plot etc.

4. Encourage investing emotionally to your character and the game-world.

5. Not work against the group cohesion

Exp rewards for failure:

Experience is applied when players go to downtime. That means

1. Exp for each scarred or damaged dice players have when going to downtime. 3 exp for the whole party.

2. Some scenes are big ones, and they provide experience, when the scene ends badly for players however, they get double
the experience from the scene. Recommended to start from 5 exp, but no more than 25 exp for the grandest of scenes
(so 50 % for double).

3. In addition, each such scene provides a 5 % to 10 % bonus for the entirety of experience gathered since the previous
downtime. That means that if players manage to push forward without going to downtime they earn experience much more
efficiently.

3.b Finally if players sacrifice significant amounts of wealth or assets to throw a party or do any other activity that
fits their roles, they can get an additional 25 % bonus

4. Each character can have a role-play objective. This is set at start of session. If they complete it, they earn 10 exp
If they don't it's exp reward goes up by 5 for the next session. This doesn't benefit from the % bonus however.

5. Group as a whole has objectives. Completing those grants experience to all players and the group organization. The
objectives depend on the organization type. There can be 3 of them, each of them provides 10 exp if they are completed
during the session. This doesn't benefit from the % bonus however.


All exp earnt by a player only provides 10 % exp to the organization exp.
All exp earnt by all players (scenes and scene failures) provides 50 % exp to the organization exp.

The exp requirement to level up is 100 exp for lvl 1 and goes up by 20 exp each level. The exp gaining doesn't increase
much, since it is all tied to the difficulty of the encounter.

New player characters start at organization exp level.
