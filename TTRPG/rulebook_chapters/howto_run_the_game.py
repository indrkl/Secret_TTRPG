Let's start with the story part of it. This is split into scenes. What is a scene?

Scene starts with a general situation, that has formed as a result of previous scene, GMs imagination of what the rest
of the world is doing, and the players' desires and agendas for this scene. It starts with a negotiation, of what
players want to achieve. During this GM should already explain how hard it could be and could already explain the
hurdles of such things, also when players say that they want to set up shop and sell mushrooms, GM could then already
say that in that location, there are lot of potential customers, but there is also competition, how do you plan to
handle the competition? Do you just accept it and try to maximise profit, is something you could offer as default, but
if they want to price race and try to bankrupt him, then they can offer this idea.

This negotiation phase should end with clear competing desires and challanges, that can be transformed into roll targets.
Roll targets can be met by anyone in the scene, they can be assigned to a single player if appropriate, these are all
the tools for the GM.

Then comes the roll, players roll their dice, and now must decide where to assign their resources, and based on that
the boundaries of the scene resolution is set. How it actually plays out in a story point of view is up to the players.

Here both GM and the players can contribute how it plays out, in the sense, if they succeed at something, players can
describe why that particular player decided to save the situation, when they failed, then how they failed, and what
was going through the mind of the players.

Roll targets can have various success. You say how much is needed to pass something, and then every power dice extra
can be a bonus. For example players decided to make money with trade, and so I say that 3XR3 is required to break even.
But if they want profit, then every R3 after first 3 will net them nice profit.

Another example is say, provide my as many as possible R6s to determine, how secure is your camp site etc. and then
the enemy for example makes a similar 6 dice check with proficiency appropriate for the general threat, and if they get
more R6s than players contributed to security, then something bad happens.

"""
Different challanges can share proficiencies and required dice, or may not. This creates strain, as if there are 3
things that require diplomacy proficiency but only one party member is proficient in it, then they probably are the only
ones who can complete any of them, and therefore need to choose. This is also part of the role playing and player
ingenuity to figure out how to achieve certain results with their skill sets to eliminate some of this pressure.

"""Roll targets come from many sources, and in general you would like to have roll targets equal to or around the number

1. Your plot, and challanges you as GM planned to provide them, so prep basically.

3. Situation, spark of the moment realisation by GM.

4. Patterns that come from experience, or repetitive checks."""

techniques = """

1. Make a roll hard, something is hard to achieve, maybe team work and assits are required, they need to tell how they
assist etc. Make a roll target 4, 5, 6, 7+

2. Choices and constraints. Have multiple roll targets, and players need to prioritize which of the roll targets they 
focus on. They may have different proficiencies, but since the scene sets the dice target, then they cannot have them
all.

3. Sinks, provide roll targets which provide something for each dice that is given to the roll target. Most usually lore
but could also be an ambush ... meaning each dice disorients one opponent.

4. Revealable. Some roll targets are only revealed after the initial roll targets have been met, and so some dice are
already commited, so there is a chance for players to be gotten off guard.

5. Change of scene atmosphere, that means the change of dice. From a friendly conversation to all of sudden getting
ambushed, so from a 2/3 to a 5/6.

6. Gamble / push / commit. Have players commit on some course of action with the trade, that they still need to get X
more dice to succeed or else suffer some consequences,  but they do get to start a new scene and therefore roll new
dice.

7. Hidden target. Players are not told the target (threat doesn't need to exist), most common to be on guard. If there
is no enemy, then commiting no dice is not punished, but if there is an enemy, then they can get ambushed if the target
is not met.

8. No roll target, just describe what they see, what is happening now, and how the scene changes because of the choices.

9. Add roll target as per player reaction.

10. Option, either of the roll targets can be met.
"""

scenarios = """

1. Players start to question beggars in the slums

Sink - lore - can ask questions from beggars

Hidden - survival - 2, how on guard they are. When they succeed then they see someone paying close attention to them and
then leaving.

2. Players approach the warehouse

Hidden - survival 3 / 4 - can they spot an ambush

3. Players try to raise money in the festival

Sink - diplomacy - get 20 gp for each dice

4. Questioning Elara

No roll target, just conversation

5. Arrived at warehouse

Hidden - survival 3 - Can they get an ambush on the warehouse guys

Sink - lore - Can they notice something important, maybe they can learn about the nature of the opponent before the
battle.

6. Players chasing guy the scout

Reveal - physique - 3 / 4 . Catch up to the scout. With 4 before his allies see him, with 3, one of his allies sees him,
there may be a fight immediately after that, noone gets ambush

Option - diplomacy - 4. Ask the locals for help to tackle the guy, and you catch him before he gets to his allies.
